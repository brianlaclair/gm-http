# gm-http ðŸ›œ
#### a simple, powerful, and easy-to-implement HTTP server for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/) projects

## Features
 - **Connection Management:** Automatically manage HTTP network connections. 
 - **Request Handling:** Parse HTTP requests, including headers, methods, and body content. 
 - **Response Handling:** Respond to requests with custom status codes, headers, and content.
 - **Incredibly flexible:** Serve up static pages or build dynamic experiences with GML.
 
## Getting Started

 1. Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/brianlaclair/gm-http/releases) or clone this repository
 2. Import the package (or drop `http.gml` into your project)
 3. You're ready to go!

##  Basic Usage

### Creation
To create an HTTP server, we need to create an instance of the `http` constructor and apply a listener to it. Each HTTP instance can have one listener applied.

```gml
// Create the instance
server = new http();

// Create a listener on that instance
server.listen(8080);
```

Your `server` instance is now listening for connections on port 8080!

### Handling Requests
In an `Async - Networking` event, we can intercept requests with the aptly named `intercept` method and handle them however we'd like to.

```gml
// Intercept and handle a network event
var connection = server.intercept();

if (!is_undefined(connection) && connection.hasRequest) {
    // Check the requested URI
    if (connection.get("uri") == "/example") {
        // Respond with a custom message
        connection.respond(200, "Hello, World!");
    } else {
        // Respond with 404 if not found
        connection.respond(404, "Page not found");
    }
}
```

In the code above, server.intercept() will return the relevant connection instance when it detects any event from it.

In this case, when the connection has a request, we're checking to see if it's looking for the resource at `/example` (http://localhost:8080/example, if you're following this guide) and return that resource to the client. If it's not, it will return a basic 404 page.

Pretty cool, right?

### Some house keeping...
As alluded to when talking about requests, all connections are stored as a struct (specifically as an instance of a `connection`). Your server instance keeps tabs on their connections within an array called `connections`. This means:

- When `intercept` detects a new connection, it creates a `connection`, adds it to the server-scoped `connections` array, and returns the pointer for that instance to you.
- In subsequent `Async - Networking` events, `intercept` will find the correct `connection` and return the pointer to you again.
- When a connection disconnects, or when you tell the connection you're disconnecting, the identifier contained within the `connection` will be marked as `-1`.

"But doesn't that leave me with a stale connection struct taking up memory??" I can hear you saying - and the answer is yes. There are many reasons you might still want that instance of `connection` to exist even if no one is on the other side - and who am I to judge?

When you *do* want to remove a stale `connection`, you can run the `reap` method - for most intents and purposes, you can just put it into your `Step` event like this:

```gml
server.reap();
```

Additionally, since when we call `listen` we're allocating a network port for use by GameMaker, we're going to want to make sure that it gets freed when we no longer need it. If you're utilizing a GameMaker object as the controller for your http instance, you'd likely want to explicitly free the port when that object no longer exists in that object's `Clean Up` event. Simply use the following code:
```gml
server.remove();
```

## Diving Deeper
### http() constructor
The http() constructor is the container for all things related to **gm-http**.
| Method | Arguments | Returns | Explanation |
|--|--|--|--|
| listen() | port (int) | Network Socket ID (real) | Creates a new listener on the specified port. If this method returns a number below 0, it means the creation of the server on the specified port has failed. Each instance of http() may only have one active listener at a time, so calling this again will handle removal automatically whenever necessary. |
|remove()|*[none]*|*[none]*|Destroys the currently active listener, if it exists.|
|intercept()|*[none]*|`connection`|Manages the states of all `connection` instances during events like client connecting, disconnecting, and sending data. Triggers parsing of requests (`connection.parseRequest(data)`) for each instance.|
|reap()|*[none]*|*[none]*|Removes inactive `connection` instances from the server instance.|

### connection() constructor
The connection() constructor contains all data related to a connection, stored in variables.

|Variable| Value | Explanation |
|--|--|--|
| connectionId | Unique ID of the connection | A consistent ID for the connection throughout and after it's lifetime |
| socket | Network Socket ID (real) | The socket that this connection is on |
| connectTime | current_time at connection start (real) | The precise moment when the connection started |
| disconnectTime | current_time at connection end (real) OR undefined | The precise moment when the connection ended |
|connected|boolean| Whether or not this connection is currently active
| hasRequest | boolean | If the connection has a request or not |
| body | boolean | Largely for internal use - if the request parser has switched from writing headers to writing into the body of the message |
| request | struct | Contains all request attributes and a request body if applicable |

While you can use these to directly manipulate the connection, and ultimately add more variables to store with the specific connection, there are a number of methods that assist with connection handling available on any connection() instance:

| Method | Arguments | Returns | Explanation |
|--|--|--|--|
|has()| request attribute (string)| boolean | Check if an attribute exists in the current request. Example: `connection.has("method")`|
|get()| request attribute (string)| string / undefined | Return a value from the request, if it exists. Example: `connection.get("method")` might return `GET`, `POST`, etc. or `undefined` if it has not yet been set |
| respond() | [HTTP Status Code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) (int, default `404`), content (string, default empty), headers (array, default empty), flush (boolean, default true)|[none]|This method builds and sends a valid HTTP response to the connection with a status code, body, and overwrite-able default header segment (see below for more on custom headers). The flush property defines if the current request will be cleared automatically when you respond.
| remove() | [none] | [none] | While a client disconnect will make the connection stale, in certain scenarios you may wish to "hang up" on a connection from the server side. |
| parseRequest() | HTTP Request (string) | [none] | Builds the connection's `request` struct from a string. In most cases, you do not need to call this method directly as [http].intercept will do it for you. | 

### Requests
When a connection has a fully formed request, it's `hasRequest` attribute returns true. All valid requests will have:

 - `request.uri` - Uniform Resource Identifier, like "/index.html" or
   "/images/my_cool_picture.jpg"
- `request.method` - The method which the request is utilizing (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc)
- `request.version` - The HTTP version being requested by the client

These attributes (and usually other headers) live in the `request` struct of a `connection` instance when that instance `hasRequest`. The `.has()` and `.get()` methods provide simple ways to interact with the `request` struct.

By design, all gm-http `connection.request` structs contain a `body` entry - by design of HTTP, it is rare (and ultimately very non-standard) to have any body content for request methods like `GET`, but in any method that would expect a body (like `POST`), the `request.body` entry is represented as a string.

Currently gm-http does not handle any parsing of the body content for you, but this may be an area of future additions built into the library.

### Response Headers
gm-http defines a default set of response HTTP headers below your response status, specifically these ones:
```http
Accept-ranges: bytes
Date: [current formatted time]
Server: GMHTTP/1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: [the byte length of your supplied content]
Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=15
```
However, all of these are modifiable, and you're able to set additional headers on a per-response basis.
For example, if I wanted to specify that I'm responding with a JSON payload I could do the following:

```gml
var my_json_string = '{"Hello":"World"}';
connection.respond(200, my_json_string, [["Content-Type", "application/json"]])
```
Which supersedes the preset value of `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`.
You can also set parameters on custom headers like so:
```gml
connection.respond(200, my_json_string, [["Content-Type", ["application/json", "parameter=totally normal"]]])
```
which would output as `Content-Type: application/json; parameter=totally normal`

Note the structure of the custom header array is an array of arrays.

The custom headers array input will take an unlimited amount of array entries, so you can set any header value you like - including `Set-Cookie` entries for session management.
